## Description

My motivation for this project was to expand on my understanding of WebSockets and the
Socket-IO API. I've been using [Miro](https://miro.com/) alot at work lately, and wanted to get a sense of how they
implemented cursor tracking for multiple users so smoothly in the browser.

## How to navigate this project

The front-end has been created with `create-react-app`. The backend is a simple Node.js `Express` server.

The `App.js` file only contains one extra component `Canvas` which is wrapped in a context provider `SocketProvider`.
The intention here is to share the Socket.IO context in a way that ensures:

- Only one Socket.IO connection is made per client.
- Re-renders on the canvas component don't cause excessive connections and duplicate clients.
- The front-end can easily emit to the node server and handle events in central place.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Canvas from "./components/canvas";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <SocketProvider>
        <Canvas />
      </SocketProvider>
    </>
  );
}
export default App;
```

## Challenges I encountered

- I faced issues such as excessive socket connections. I solved this by moving socket events and updates to be managed through the React context API and
propagated through to the canvas component.
- Understanding the Socket-IO paradigm around broadcasting to `rooms`(and which clients should receive these updates) was something that I didn't
grasp initially.
- There is alot of freedom with how you can manage your socket connections with the Socket-IO API.
Adding any sort of stateful updates on the back-end can quickly become difficult to replicate to all clients on the front-end.

## What else would I do

- Refactor the context approach with a state management middleware such as `redux` to handle updating results from the
socket events. I ended up passing more data on each move of the cursor (clients cursor colour) than I would of liked.
- Add the ability to create sticky notes and other elements on the canvas, similar to miro.
- Add a persistance layer to the back-end to save the elements created by users.
