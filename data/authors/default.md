Hi, I'm Nick.

I work as a software developer and am based in Australia. I have built applications for manufacturing, health and now work in finance. 

One of my main interests is building user interfaces, and it is something I have always had a passion for. I currently work full stack and love working with JavaScript on the front-end and .NET for back-end development.

When I am not at work or playing with tech I like to hang out with my dog Buddy.
